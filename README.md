How to Run

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.
1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local system:
code Sh
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OrbitOps.git

  

2. Navigate into the Project

Open the project in your terminal (or VS Code terminal):
code Sh
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
cd OrbitOps

  

3. Start the Backend Services

You will need two separate terminals for the backend services.

In your first terminal:
code Sh
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
# Navigate to the first backend folder
cd backend

# Install its dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev```

**Open a SECOND terminal and run:**
```sh
# Navigate to the second backend folder
cd backend_satwik

# Install its dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev

  

4. Start the Frontend

Finally, you will need a third terminal for the frontend.

Open a THIRD terminal and run:
code Sh
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install its dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

  

5. View the Application

The last command will give you a localhost link, usually http://localhost:5173/. Open this link in your browser to see the OrbitOps application live.
